# CineMatch: Movie Recommendation Engine

## üìù Project Overview

CineMatch is a sophisticated movie recommendation system that combines multiple recommendation techniques to deliver personalized movie suggestions. The project implements collaborative filtering, content-based filtering, and hybrid approaches to provide users with accurate and diverse movie recommendations.

## Planed Features

- **Multiple Recommendation Algorithms**
  - Collaborative filtering (user-based and item-based)
  - Content-based recommendations using movie metadata
  - Matrix factorization with Singular Value Decomposition (SVD)
  - Hybrid recommendation approach

- **Personalization**
  - User preference learning
  - Cold-start handling for new users
  - Diversity-aware recommendations
  - Time-aware suggestions (trending, seasonal)

- **Explainable Recommendations**
  - Recommendation reasoning
  - Visual explanation of why movies were suggested
  - User preference insights

- **User Interface**
  - Movie browsing with filters
  - Personal recommendation dashboard
  - Rating and feedback collection
  - User profile management

- **Performance Optimization**
  - Efficient recommendation algorithms
  - Caching strategies
  - Database query optimization

- **Analytics**
  - Algorithm performance metrics
  - User engagement tracking
  - A/B testing framework

## üõ†Ô∏è Tech Stack

- **Backend**: Python 3.10+, Flask, SQLAlchemy
- **Data Processing**: Pandas, NumPy, SciPy
- **Machine Learning**: Scikit-learn, Surprise
- **Database**: PostgreSQL
- **Frontend**: React, Bootstrap
- **Visualization**: Matplotlib, Plotly
- **Containerization**: Docker
- **Testing**: Pytest, Locust (load testing)
- **Deployment**: AWS

### Dataset

CineMatch uses the [MovieLens 25M Dataset](https://grouplens.org/datasets/movielens/25m/) which includes:
- 25 million ratings
- 62,000 movies
- 162,000 users
- Tag data

The dataset is automatically downloaded and processed during the first build.

But for development I'm using the small dataset version


## üìà Development Roadmap

| Phase | Focus | Status |
|-------|-------|--------|
| 1 | Foundation & Data Processing | In Progress |
| 2 | Advanced Algorithms | Planned |
| 3 | Web Application | Planned |
| 4 | Advanced Features | Planned |
| 5 | Optimization & Documentation | Planned |

## üîç Algorithm Details

### Collaborative Filtering
User-based and item-based collaborative filtering identify patterns in user preferences and recommend movies based on what similar users have enjoyed.

### Content-Based Filtering
Analyzes movie attributes (genres, actors, directors) to recommend similar content based on user's previously rated movies.

### Matrix Factorization
Implements SVD to uncover latent factors that explain the observed preferences and uses these to make predictions.

### Hybrid Approach
Combines multiple recommendation techniques to overcome the limitations of individual approaches and provide more robust recommendations.

## üìä Evaluation Metrics

The recommendation engine is evaluated using:
- Root Mean Square Error (RMSE)
- Precision@k
- Recall@k
- Mean Average Precision (MAP)
- Diversity metrics
- User satisfaction (collected through feedback)
